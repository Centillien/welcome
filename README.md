Elgg Welcome plugin
=======

This plugin is for newly registered users, it provides a welcome page before email validation. It will show the registration name and email they used at registration and a reminder to check his email.

You can use it to provide some additional information to a new user too. This plugin is only useful in combination with the Elgg `uservalidationbyemail` plugin.
